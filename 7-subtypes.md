#### Objectives of this Reading

+ Subclassing &amp; inheritance: superclass inheritance is the source of several problems that we'll examine in this reading.
+ Composition &amp; delegation: a commonly-used pattern to avoid the problems of subclassing.
+ Subtyping: we'll look at the relationship between subtypes and subclasses.
  Careful thinking about the specifications of our types will guide our use of subtyping.
